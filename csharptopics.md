## The Common Language Runtime (CLR)
  ``` The Common Language Runtime (CLR) is an Execution Environment . It works as a layer between Operating Systems and the applications written in .Net languages that conforms to the Common Language Specification (CLS). The main function of Common Language Runtime (CLR) is to convert the Managed Code into native code and then execute the Program. The Managed Code compiled only when it needed, that is it converts the appropriate instructions when each function is called . The Common Language Runtime (CLR) 's Just In Time (JIT) compilation converts Intermediate Language (MSIL) to native code on demand at application run time.```

## What is  Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) 
  ``` MSIL stands for Microsoft Intermediate Language. We can call it as Intermediate Language (IL) or Common Intermediate Language (CIL). During the compile time , the compiler convert the source code into Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) .Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) is a CPU-independent set of instructions that can be efficiently converted to the native code. During the runtime the Common Language Runtime (CLR)'s Just In Time (JIT) compiler converts the Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) code into native code to the Operating System. ```

## Just In Time Compiler - JIT
  ``` The .Net languages , which is conforms to the Common Language Specification (CLS), uses its corresponding runtime to run the application on different Operating Systems . During the code execution time, the Managed Code compiled only when it is needed, that is it converts the appropriate instructions to the native code for execution just before when each function is called. This process is called Just In Time (JIT) compilation, also known as Dynamic Translation . With the help of Just In Time Compiler (JIT) the Common Language Runtime (CLR) doing these tasks. ```

  - `A static class is declared using the "static" keyword. If the class is declared as static then the compiler never creates an instance of the class. All the member fields, properties and functions must be declared as static and they are accessed by the class name directly not by a class instance object.`
