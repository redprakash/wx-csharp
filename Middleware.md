# Middleware
Middleware is software that's assembled into an app pipeline to handle requests and responses. 
Each component:
   - Chooses whether to pass the request to the next component in the pipeline.
   - Can perform work before and after the next component in the pipeline.

 ``` A middleware is nothing but a component (class) which is executed on every request in ASP.NET Core application.```
