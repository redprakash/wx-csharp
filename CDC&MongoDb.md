# MongoDB Change Stream
    MongoDB Change Streams track real-time data changes across a database, a collection, or an entire deployment, 
    allowing you to immediately react to these changes. It gives users the power to track changes without having to 
    continuously monitor the operations log (oplog).

    and high availability, and are the basis for all production deployments.
    
    A Replica Set is a group of daemon processes for a data set that ensures that your data is distributed and replicated across 
    multiple servers. This ensures data integrity, especially in cases of any server failure or experience-related issues.
