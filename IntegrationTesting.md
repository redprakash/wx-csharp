# ASP.NET Core Integration Testing
``` Integration tests ensure that an app's components function correctly at a level that includes the app's supporting infrastructure, 
    such as the database, file system, and network. ASP.NET Core supports integration tests using a unit test framework with a 
    test web host and an in-memory test server. ```
